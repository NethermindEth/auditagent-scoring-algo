While it prevents certain donation-based ratio attacks, it creates a denial-of-service condition where legitimate users can be permanently unable to redeem or start a cooldown. Example: if totalSupply = 0.012 shares and two users each hold 0.006 shares (MIN_SHARES = 0.01), any single user's withdrawal would leave totalSupply = 0.006 (< MIN_SHARES) and will revert, trapping both users' funds unless a third party deposits to raise totalSupply.

However, for the PENDLE_OUT branch, retAmount from pendleExit() is the amount of tokenOut redeemed, not assetIn spent (and pendleExit does not use swapParams.assetIn at all).

Consequences: when the scheduled rate decreases, the first update after the boundary over-allocates rewards at the old higher rate; when it increases, it under-allocates.
