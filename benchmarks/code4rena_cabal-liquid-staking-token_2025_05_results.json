There is no check that share_diff is non-negative. If a slash or other share-reducing event occurs between the initial query (before MsgDelegate) and the post-delegate query in the hook (or if the query returns a stale view), share_after could be less than share_before, making share_diff negative. This negative value is then added to total_locked_shares and the user's per-position locked share, corrupting accounting (potentially producing negative locked_share values).\nWhere:\n- delegate_hook_internal(): computes share_diff = bigdecimal::sub(share_after, share_before) and passes it to share_to_locked_share(), then deposit_delegation() without validating non-negativity.\nWhy it's a security issue: Recording negative locked shares corrupts the state and can break subsequent calculations (e.g., locked_share_to_amount), leading to underflows/incorrect amounts or DoS on later withdraw/extend operations.\nPotential impact: Data corruption, potential inability to undelegate/extend later, or incorrect amount calculations that could either over- or under-credit a user."

If a user accumulates more than 65,535 distinct lock slots for the same validator, the increment will overflow and abort.
