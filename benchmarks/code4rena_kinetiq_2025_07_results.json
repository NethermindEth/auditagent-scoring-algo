In updateValidatorMetrics (external), each call adds the provided validator to the _validators set. There is no mechanism to remove validators or cap the set size. The getValidators() function returns _validators.values(), which copies the entire set into memory. If the set becomes large, on-chain callers that rely on getValidators() may hit block gas limits and revert, resulting in a denial of service for protocols that integrate this oracle on-chain. A compromised or malicious operator (or an operator making mistakes) can add a very large number of distinct validator addresses, amplifying this risk. Impact: On-chain consumers that iterate over or rely on getValidators() in transactions can be bricked or griefed due to out-of-gas errors; off-chain calls are not affected."

As the number of authorized contracts grows, the gas cost of this O(n) loop grows linearly. Once the set is large enough, emergencyPauseAll may become impossible to execute within block gas limits and will revert, preventing any emergency pause action. This is a security issue because the emergency pause is a safety mechanism intended to be callable under stress; making it potentially uncallable defeats its purpose and can lead to broader protocol risk if pausing is required during an incident. Potential impact: denial of service of the emergency pause capability, which could enable continued operation under unsafe conditions or hinder incident response."

While the implementation contract's constructor disables initializers, if a proxy pointing to this logic is deployed without atomically calling initialize in the same transaction, any external account can call initialize first and grant themselves DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE, UNPAUSER_ROLE, and PAUSE_ALL_ROLE by supplying their own addresses as parameters. This results in unauthorized control over the registry: the attacker could authorize arbitrary contracts, pause/unpause targets, or permanently disrupt operations.

This occurs in generatePerformance() within the loop over authorizedOracles when calling IOracleAdapter(oracle).getPerformance(validator).

This occurs in generatePerformance() during aggregation: totalBalance += balance; totalRewardAmount += accRewardAmount; totalSlashAmount += accSlashAmount. Scores are bounded by maxPerformanceBound, but balances/rewards/slashes are not.
