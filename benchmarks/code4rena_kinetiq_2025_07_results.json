    "finding_description_from_junior_auditor": "The whenNotPaused modifier calls an external contract pauserRegistry.isPaused(address(this)) before function execution. Several state-changing functions apply modifiers in the order whenNotPaused nonReentrant ... (e.g., rebalanceWithdrawal, closeRebalanceRequests, deactivateValidator, reactivateValidator, setDelegation). Because modifiers execute left-to-right, the external call to pauserRegistry occurs before the ReentrancyGuard is engaged. A malicious or compromised pauserRegistry could reenter this contract during the pause check. While role checks on state-changing functions mitigate most direct exploits, a misconfigured setup where pauserRegistry also holds privileged roles (e.g., MANAGER_ROLE) would allow it to perform privileged actions via reentrancy, bypassing expected sequencing and potentially causing inconsistent state or unexpected side effects. At minimum, this widens the attack surface and violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern."

    "finding_description_from_junior_auditor": "The contract maintains an ever-growing set of validators and exposes a function that returns the entire set. In updateValidatorMetrics (external), each call adds the provided validator to the _validators set. There is no mechanism to remove validators or cap the set size. The getValidators() function returns _validators.values(), which copies the entire set into memory. If the set becomes large, on-chain callers that rely on getValidators() may hit block gas limits and revert, resulting in a denial of service for protocols that integrate this oracle on-chain. A compromised or malicious operator (or an operator making mistakes) can add a very large number of distinct validator addresses, amplifying this risk. Impact: On-chain consumers that iterate over or rely on getValidators() in transactions can be bricked or griefed due to out-of-gas errors; off-chain calls are not affected."

As the number of authorized contracts grows, the gas cost of this O(n) loop grows linearly. Once the set is large enough, emergencyPauseAll may become impossible to execute within block gas limits and will revert, preventing any emergency pause action. This is a security issue because the emergency pause is a safety mechanism intended to be callable under stress; making it potentially uncallable defeats its purpose and can lead to broader protocol risk if pausing is required during an incident. Potential impact: denial of service of the emergency pause capability, which could enable continued operation under unsafe conditions or hinder incident response."

This occurs in generatePerformance() during aggregation: totalBalance += balance; totalRewardAmount += accRewardAmount; totalSlashAmount += accSlashAmount. Scores are bounded by maxPerformanceBound, but balances/rewards/slashes are not.
