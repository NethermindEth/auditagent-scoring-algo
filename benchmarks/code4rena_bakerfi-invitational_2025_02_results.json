Specifically: _deploy returns the value from vault.deposit, which is shares minted (not assets). _undeploy returns the value from vault.withdraw, which is shares burned (not assets). _getBalance returns vault.balanceOf(this), which is the shares balance (not the underlying asset amount). If StrategySupplyBase expects these functions to operate and report in asset units (common for strategy bases), this mismatch will cause incorrect NAV/accounting, potentially leading to under-withdrawals, over-withdrawals, insolvency, or DoS conditions when the system believes more/less assets exist than actually do. Where it occurs: _deploy(), _undeploy(), and _getBalance() functions. Why it's a security issue: Incorrect unit handling in strategy accounting can directly lead to loss of funds (e.g., withdrawing based on inflated balances), privilege-like effects (ability to bypass safeguards relying on correct balances), or denial of service due to invariant violations. Potential impact: Mispriced shares, failed withdrawals, or draining of funds if higher-level logic trusts these values for asset movements."

Why it's a security issue: The admin can grant/revoke PROPOSER_ROLE, EXECUTOR_ROLE, and (in recent OZ versions) CANCELLER_ROLE, and can revoke these from legitimate governance actors. This enables censorship (canceling or preventing proposals), governance DoS, or granting themselves proposer/executor privileges. While admin cannot directly bypass the timelock delay or change it without a scheduled operation, this centralizes control and can be abused, especially if combined with a low delay. Potential impact: Governance capture/DoS by revoking roles, censorship by granting CANCELLER_ROLE, and potential malicious scheduling/execution if the delay is small enough to limit reaction time."

What the vulnerability is: If deployed with _minDelay = 0 (or an inappropriately small value), operations can be scheduled and executed immediately or with negligible delay, effectively negating timelock protections. Why it's a security issue: A zero/very low delay undermines the security assumptions of a timelock, enabling rapid execution of malicious operations with minimal time for detection and response. Potential impact: Loss of funds or protocol manipulation through immediate execution of harmful proposals; denial of service to governance processes that rely on a meaningful delay window."
