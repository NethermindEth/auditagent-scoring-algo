This prevents any designated operator from executing operational functions, and if the owner is ever marked as an operator, all onlyOperator functions become permanently inaccessible until the mapping is corrected. Where: modifier onlyOperator() near the top of the contract; affects functions harvest(uint256,address[]), harvestAndDelegateRewards(uint256,address[],address), delegateAmount(uint256,uint256[],address[]), redelegateAmount(uint256,uint256[],address[],address[]), undelegateAmount(uint256,uint256[],address[]), and finaliseRonRewardsForEpoch(). Why it's a security issue: It constitutes a broken access control that can cause denial of service of core management and withdrawal-finalization flows. Potential impact: Operators cannot harvest or manage delegation, and more critically, users\u2019 epoch-based withdrawal requests cannot be finalized (finaliseRonRewardsForEpoch), leaving withdrawals stuck until the owner fixes operator mapping; if the owner mistakenly sets operator[owner] = true, even the owner is blocked from performing these critical operations."

Why it's a security issue: Pausable is typically an emergency control to halt state-changing operations such as deposits. Allowing deposits via the fallback undermines that control and can lead to continued inflows during emergencies or incidents.

Where: harvest() function, the for-loop calling claimRewards with the entire array each iteration (around lines 26-34). Why it's a security issue: If the underlying Ronin staking contract prevents double-claiming within a block/epoch, subsequent calls may revert, causing the whole harvest() to fail (DoS on harvesting). If it does not revert but performs heavy processing each time, it unnecessarily increases gas usage and could hit block gas limits for larger arrays, again leading to DoS. In the worst case, if the external contract has an accounting flaw and allows repeated claims, this could over-withdraw rewards.
