      "title": "Acceptance of empty return as success in ERC20 transferFrom allows fake transfers (non-contract assets)",
      "description": "The private helper _callTransferFromWithSuffix in OrderMixin treats a CALL to the 'asset' address as successful if it returns empty returndata, without verifying that the target is actually a token contract. In the EVM, calling an EOA or a non-existent address returns success with empty returndata. As a result, a malicious maker can set makerAsset (or takerAsset) to an EOA or non-contract address, and the router will consider transferFrom successful even though no tokens were transferred. This occurs in OrderMixin._callTransferFromWithSuffix and is used by both Maker->Taker and Taker->Maker transfers in _fill (OrderMixin._fill). Why it's a security issue: an attacker can craft an order where makerAsset is an EOA (or address(0)), causing the Maker->Taker transfer to be a no-op but considered successful; subsequently, the Taker->Maker transfer will transfer real tokens from the taker to the maker, resulting in loss of funds for the taker. Potential impact: taker loses funds by filling a malicious order whose token address is not a real ERC20.",

Anyone can call this function and pull any token held by the router (up to its balance). While typical flows try to keep only 1 wei residues, in Curve flows the router can temporarily hold substantial token amounts (e.g., before or during swaps with callback). A malicious contract or misconfigured route could exploit this to drain tokens from the router. Where it occurs: UnoswapRouter.curveSwapCallback(). Why it's a security issue: an arbitrary external caller can trigger an ERC20 transfer from the router to themselves, enabling theft of tokens present on the router. Potential impact: theft of tokens stored on the router address (accidental deposits, residual balances, or temporarily held tokens during Curve routes if an attacker can trigger the callback out of band).",

They can then call cashOut to withdraw ERC20 from the contract, draining reserves funded by other users. The ETH becomes stuck in the contract (no withdrawal path), resulting in reserve imbalance and potential theft if ERC20 value > ETH sent. (2) Honest users depositing ERC20 with msg.value = 0 will transfer underlying tokens to the contract via _transferAssetFromUser(amount) but receive 0 VirtualToken because _mint uses msg.value; this leads to direct, unrecoverable loss of deposited ERC20.
