      "title": "Unchecked subtraction can underflow and wrap in buy and sell paths",
      "description": "The program performs plain u64 subtraction when computing net input/output after fees without guarding against underflow. Specifically: (1) In the buy branch of handler(), it computes `buy_amount_applied = exact_in_amount - fee_lamports`. If `fee_lamports > exact_in_amount`, this underflows and wraps to a very large u64 in release builds, producing an unintended, massive input to `apply_buy`. (2) In complete_sell(), it computes `sell_amount_minus_fee = sell_result.sol_amount - fee_lamports`. If `fee_lamports > sell_result.sol_amount`, this underflows and wraps to a very large u64. Why it's a security issue: Wrapped values can cause incorrect amount calculations. In the buy path, this can violate exact-in semantics and charge the user more lamports than `exact_in_amount` (because the program later pulls `buy_result.sol_amount` lamports from the user plus `fee_lamports`, without ensuring `fee_lamports <= exact_in_amount`). In both buy and sell paths, wrapped values can also cause subsequent SOL transfers to attempt moving an impossibly large amount, leading to transaction failure (DoS for the caller). Potential impact: - Loss of funds: Users can be overcharged beyond their intended `exact_in_amount` if `calculate_fee` returns more than the input. - Denial of service: Wrapped amounts will trigger failing system transfers (insufficient funds), reverting the transaction. Where it occurs: - handler() buy branch: statement `buy_amount_applied = exact_in_amount - fee_lamports` - complete_sell(): statement `sell_amount_minus_fee = sell_result.sol_amount - fee_lamports`",
