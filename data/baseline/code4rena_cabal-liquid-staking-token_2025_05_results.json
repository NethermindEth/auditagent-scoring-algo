      "description": "When a snapshot is initiated in the current block, check_snapshot() returns early and does not record a per-account snapshot if there was no previous snapshot (prev_snapshot_block is None). Later, get_snapshot_balance() for that snapshot block may return the current (post-change) balance instead of the state at the snapshot time. This occurs because: (1) check_snapshot() exits early when current_block_height == current_snapshot_block and prev_snapshot_block is None, so no snapshot entry is written for the account; (2) get_snapshot_balance_internal() then falls back to returning the current balance if the snapshot table is empty and the account existed at or before the requested block. As a result, users can perform transfers or receive tokens in the same block as the snapshot and have those changes reflected in the snapshot, violating snapshot immutability.\n\nWhere: check_snapshot(c_balance, current_snapshot_block, prev_snapshot_block) and get_snapshot_balance_internal(); specifically the early-return branch in check_snapshot when current_block_height == current_snapshot_block and option::is_none(&prev_snapshot_block), and the fallback path in get_snapshot_balance_internal() that returns cabal_balance.balance when the snapshot table is empty.\n\nWhy it's a security issue: Snapshot-based logic (governance voting power, reward distribution, airdrop eligibility) expects balances at the snapshot height to be immutable. This logic bug allows users to manipulate their snapshot balance by executing balance-changing operations within the same block as snapshot(), after the snapshot is taken.\n\nPotential impact: Protocol manipulation of governance/rewards by inflating (or reshuffling) balances attributed to the snapshot block via in-block transfers/mints occurring after the snapshot call.",

This can misreport historical balances and affect any logic relying on accurate historical reads.\n\nWhere: get_snapshot_balance_internal(), at the iterator usage:\n- iter := table::iter(&cabal_balance.snapshot, option::some(key), option::none(), 2)\n- if prepare(iter) then return the first table::next(iter) value unconditionally\n\nWhy it's a security issue: Returning a future snapshot can inflate or deflate a user's reported historical balance, enabling manipulation of snapshot-based protocols if an attacker can cause a snapshot to be written shortly after the target height (e.g., by triggering interactions right after the target block so that the next snapshot gets recorded and then used for earlier queries).\n\nPotential impact: Incorrect reward/voting distributions or other historical-balance-dependent logic, enabling protocol manipulation.",

      "description": "The per-validator delegation count is stored as u16 in staking_account.validators. In deposit_delegation, the code increments this counter (*count = *count + 1) and in withdraw_delegation decrements it (*count = *count - 1). If a user accumulates more than 65,535 distinct lock slots for the same validator, the increment will overflow and abort. Because deposit_delegation is executed inside the hook after the stargate message (MsgDelegate/MsgBeginRedelegate) has been sent, an overflow abort could occur after Cosmos-side state changed. If the stargate call is not atomically rolled back on Move abort, this would desynchronize on-chain staking state and internal accounting in Move.\nWhere:\n- deposit_delegation(): increments u16 count in validators table\n- withdraw_delegation(): decrements u16 count and may underflow if inconsistent\nWhy it's a security issue: Integer overflow/underflow causes aborts. If this happens during a hook after stargate side-effects, it risks leaving the system in an inconsistent state (depending on runtime atomicity guarantees). Even if atomic, a user can self-DoS their account by making future operations fail once the counter reaches the limit.\nPotential impact: Denial of service for affected account; potential protocol/state desynchronization if stargate effects are not rolled back on abort.",
