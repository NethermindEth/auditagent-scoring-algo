      "description": "Multiple places mix 18-decimal WAD amounts with underlying token native decimals without proper scaling, leading to incorrect transfers and accounting. Examples: (1) In liquidatePosition(), repayAmount is treated as WAD for pricing math (used in wdiv/wmul with discountedPrice) but is then sent directly via poolUnderlying.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(pool), repayAmount - penalty) without converting to the underlying token's decimals. penalty is also computed in WAD and used directly in transfers and IPoolV3Loop.mintProfit(penalty). (2) In liquidatePosition(), pool.repayCreditAccount(debtData.debt - newDebt, profit, 0) passes unscaled values, whereas elsewhere in modifyCollateralAndDebt() the remaining debt is scaled (scaledRemainingDebt = wmul(debtData.debt - newDebt, poolUnderlyingScale)) before calling pool.repayCreditAccount. (3) In modifyCollateralAndDebt() repay branch, profit (computed in WAD) is passed to pool.repayCreditAccount(scaledRemainingDebt, profit, 0) without scaling to underlying decimals. (4) In liquidatePositionBadDebt(), the same pattern exists: repayAmount is used directly for token transfer, and pool.repayCreditAccount(debtData.debt, profit, loss) is called with unscaled values; updateQuotaRevenue is also called with unscaled quotaRevenueChange (unlike the scaled call in modifyCollateralAndDebt). Why it's a security issue: When the underlying token has non-18 decimals (e.g., USDC with 6), these paths will under/over-pay the pool, break liquidations (DoS), or mis-account profit/loss. This can lead to denial of service of liquidations, protocol accounting drift, or unintended fund movement. Potential impact: \u2022 Liquidations may revert or clear with incorrect amounts; \u2022 Over/underpayment to the pool making the system insolvent or causing loss to liquidators/LPs; \u2022 Mis-accounted profit/loss and quota revenue.",
