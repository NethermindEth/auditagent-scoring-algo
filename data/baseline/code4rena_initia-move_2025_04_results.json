      "description": "In vote(), the contract computes weight_sum by iterating over the entire weights vector, but then constructs the actual voting pairs using vector::zip_reverse(bridge_ids, weights, ...), which only pairs up to min(len(bridge_ids), len(weights)) and silently drops any extra items. Next, apply_vote() updates per-bridge tallies only for the paired subset, but proposal.total_tally is increased by voting_power_used computed from the full weight_sum of all provided weights. This accounting mismatch allows an attacker to pass many extra weights (with sum close to 1) while providing very few bridge_ids. The result is a large increase to proposal.total_tally without a corresponding increase to any bridge tallies. Later, remove_vote() subtracts only the per-bridge amounts that were actually applied (paired subset), leaving the inflated excess in total_tally. Because execute_proposal_internal() computes each bridge's final weight as tally_i / total_tally, an attacker can inflate the denominator so much that all resulting weights approach zero, effectively nullifying the vote outcome.",

Due to truncation, floor(sum) can be strictly greater than \u03a3 floor(parts). Conversely, remove_vote() decrements proposal.total_tally by \u03a3 floor(weight_i * max_voting_power). Therefore, a voter can repeatedly toggle between a split-weight vote (with many small weights summing to 1) and a zero-weight vote within the same cycle to accumulate a net increase of [floor(sum) \u2212 \u03a3 floor(parts)] in total_tally each iteration, while restoring bridge tallies back to their prior values.

      "description": "The module validates that commission-related values are <= 1 but does not enforce non-negativity. Specifically, check_valid_rate only asserts rate <= 1, and update_operator_commission does not call check_valid_rate at all. As a result, during registration and subsequent updates, commission_rate (and even commission_max_rate and commission_max_change_rate at registration) can be negative. Locations: check_valid_rate(), check_valid_commission_rates(), register_operator_store(), update_operator_commission(). This is a security issue because BigDecimal is signed, and allowing negative commission rates can invert fee flows or cause incorrect accounting when these values are later used in financial calculations by other modules (e.g., paying out more than intended or extracting funds by setting a negative fee). Potential impact includes loss of funds, protocol manipulation, or data corruption in downstream logic relying on commission invariants.",
